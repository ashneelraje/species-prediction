# species-prediction
This is a platform that will help nature enthusiasts classify different species that they find in the wild. 


You will first have to install tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib and streamlit in your system by using these commands in cmd.

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install streamlit
pip install tensorflow

Download any species dataset from kaggle. 
Run the ipynb file in vs code after changing the location of the train, test and valid set. Put the path of the dataset you have downloaded.
Now run the stream.py file through pycharm after changing the h5 file.
Command for running the py file is-
streamlit run stream.py

If you want to use the a=same dataset I have used then go to kaggle and download the dataset 'species105'. If you use this dataset then you can also use the database file i have uploaded.
